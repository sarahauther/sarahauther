### Hi 👋
#### Welcome to my GitHub profile for COMM 160DS!
- I am a third year comm major at UCSB and I am hoping to learn a lot about data science through this course. I don't have much knowledge about python but I am hoping to learn enough to get me started. 
- I love running and I am on the UCSB Track Team 🏃‍♀️
- Outside of school and athletics, I love being outside in nature or at the beach 🏖
